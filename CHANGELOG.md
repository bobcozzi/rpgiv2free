# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


## [0.6.0] - 2025-05-14
- A major rewrite of D spec seletion and free format line formatting.
- Fixed several bugs in how the full D spec statement was selected. In edge cases it was dropping the end of a Long Variable name. This has now been corrected.
- Quoted literals on D specs are now retaining embedded consecutive blanks. It does this in two ways, (1) Avoids compressing them and (2) If the line breaks onto a new line at a set of blanks, then the - is used to continue and the next line starts in column 8. NOTE: If you migrate to fully free format RPG IV, then you will need to adjust that start position (to 1) accordingly.
- NOTE: NO CALC SPEC changes or enhancements have been made to this build.

## [0.5.8] - 2025-05-9
### Fixed
- Corrected an issue with the AddEXTDeviceFlag settings flag that caused it to be ignored.
- Updated the readme.md file with more accurate information.
- Data Structures with a Length (legacy "To pos") and/or OCCURS (legacy "From pos") now convert to LEN() and OCCURS() keyuwords respectively.

## [0.5.5] - 2025-05-8
### Fixed
- Corrected an issue with protypes and placement of end-pr. Also fixed the same issue on PI statements.

## [0.5.3] - 2025-05-7
### Added
- Support for END and ENDSR handling.
- Corrected an issue with data structure conversion
- Enhanced how the END-DS location is determined for better results.
- Convert comments better in more situations.
- Add new option to disable the *EXT flag/parameter on externally described file device IDs. That is DISK(*EXT) can now be generated as DISK when this new option is turned off. See SETTINGS for details.

### Fixed
- File specs now interpret the Keyed/nonKeyed flag properly.
- Conversion of final line in a source member is now handled correctly.

### Changed
- Updated extension dependencies for better compatibility with the latest VS Code releases.
- Refined UI elements for a more consistent look and feel within VS Code.
- Improved documentation and in-editor tooltips for extension commands.

## [0.5.2] - 2025-05-06
### New
- Extension renamed from rpgivfree to rpgiv2free to better clarify its role.
- SELECT/WHENxx statements now convert properly.
- Comments generated by the conversion tools are now properly embedded above the converted code.

## [0.4.8] - 2025-05-06
### Added
- Added several opcodes to the conversion engine. ADD, SUB, MULT, DIV, ALLOC, DEALLOC, REALLOC, CASxx, COMP, CAT, CALLP.
## [0.4.7] - 2025-05-05
### Fixed
- Corrected an issue where END-DS was being added multiple times when non-LIKEDS Data Structures were converted.
- Corrected a cross platoform linefeed issue. Windows/Linux/Mac use different linefeed sequences. The extension now uses the linefeed sequence of the current file/platform.
- Corrected the issue with Boolean Opcodes such as IFEQ, IFNE, WHENEQ, WHENGT and their "Extended Factor 2" variants. The extension now correctly decerns these opcodes from their extended Factor 2 variants.
- Resolved the issue where multiple consecutive embedded blanks in quoted strings were being compressed when converted to free format.
- Corrected the "catch all" Calc Spec opcode conversion routine that converts opcodes that are not explicitly handled (such as "TEST") to free format. No if there is no customized handler for the Opcode, it is converted to "opcode factor1 factor2 resultField;" and resulting indicators (if any) are lost.
## [0.4.6] - 2025-05-03
### Added
- Converting a Data Structure "header" line or the PI or PR statements results in the corresponding END-xx being generated after the list of child nodes.
- Reactivating File spec conversion (it was removed accidentally in 0.4.4).
- Fixed an issue with the Extension's Activation.
-
## [0.4.3] - 2025-05-02
### Added
- `SUBDUR` opcode handling:
  - Standard format using `%<duration>()`.
  - `%DIFF` format when result field contains duration keyword.
- Intelligent detection of `SUBDUR` variants based on colons in Factor 2 or Result.
- Support for converting `ADDDUR` opcode to free-format using built-in `%<duration>()` functions.

### Fixed
- Now safely handles missing duration keywords in `ADDDUR` and `SUBDUR`.

### Added
- Greatly simplified extracted H-specs and conversion to `ctl-opt` free-form line, ignoring commented-out specs.
- `collectHSpecs` function to extract fixed-format H-specs (column 6 = 'H').
- Initial implementation of `convertHSpec` to consolidate multiple H-specs.

## [0.4.2] - 2025-05-01
### Added
- Resolved issues with IF statements that used extented Factor 2.
- Boolean opcode collector (`collectBooleanOpcode`) for RPG IV fixed format logic.
- Handling of boolean opcodes: `IFxx`, `WHENxx`, `ANDxx`, `ORxx`.
